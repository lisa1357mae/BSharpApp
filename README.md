# BSharpApp

We are creating an app that is similar to YELP but for music concert reviews.

A user can make a profile and review concerts from a dropdown menu of recent shows. They can also browse through other user profiles as well.

New users will be able to upload an avatar to their profile page, post reviews and delete all of their content
